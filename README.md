# Descriptive-statistics
Part of the most basic statistics that can never be separated in data analysis.

### Descriptive statistics are very useful in presenting data.

1. Provide an overview and description of how the information held by the data. Descriptive statistics must be able to provide an overview of what information can be obtained from the data we use. Instead of just using numbers without a standard format, it will be more interesting if they are displayed in graphs and tables.

2. Describe the characteristics of a data. Descriptive statistics also provide characteristics about the data used. This is important because the condition of the data used will affect all data analysis that we do.

By understanding the characteristics, we can choose the appropriate treatment in a more in-depth analysis later

Here I will share how to calculate basic descriptive statistics using [python 3.7.6](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-376/)
